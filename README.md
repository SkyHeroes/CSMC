# CSMC
CS in minecraft - plugin primarly written by DanaBlend

Further development of the plugin As the original creator of the plugin, danablend has retired from the project, and barpec12 took over the plugin development. Meanwhile tontito007 continued the project giving support for multi map and Folia servers

Introduction: CSMC is a gamemode that changes everything about Minecraft, adding the classic "Defuse" Counter Strike gamemode, where Terrorists gotta plant the bomb while Counter Terrorists should protect bomb sites, and defuse the bomb if it would be planted.

More gamemodes are planned out for the future.

Dependencies: CSMC needs the following things for the plugin to start:

    Quality Armory - Currently no official version supporting Folia

    Map to play the game

    Positions set up (More about that under the "Setting up" section)

Setting up: Before you can start playing the game, there are some things that needs to be clear and set up. That includes the following things:

    Set up a lobby location (VIA In-game commands - /csmc setlobby)

    Set up spawn points for both teams (VIA In-game commands - /csmc setspawn counterterrorist/terrorist)

    Place bedrock or obsidian on the bomb-spots (config bomb-block:)

    Start game by tapping a colour from Yellow, Blue, Red or Green

    Optionally mess around with the configuration to fit your needs

    SQLite BD is supported to have multi map
